        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>
          Watch This! is a church with a mission to follow God with our whole heart, working to establish his kingdom in Anchorage and
          wherever we go.
        </p>

        <p>
          We meet on Thursday evenings at 300 E Dimond Blvd, Suite 11A, in the AK Dance Promotions space, across from Red Robin. Our
          meetings begin with a pot-luck meal at 6:30 PM. The rest of the meeting gets going around 7:00 pm. We might sing or we might just
          pray. We are always seeking the leading of the Holy Spirit. Typically, there will be a short teaching with plenty of discussion,
          prayer and personal and corporate application.
        </p>
